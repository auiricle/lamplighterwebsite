				<br><br><p>Lamplighter Productions, founded in 2015, is a hybrid arts production company. We explore the boundaries of pop culture and political activism through multidisciplinary art production. Our members are filmmakers, musicians, actors, and dramaturges with a deep respect for the social experience of art making, united around a shared desire to improve the world. Because all of our projects are created non-hierarchically, with creative power dispersed equally, we are able to model new forms of collaboration and engagement through our work.</p>
