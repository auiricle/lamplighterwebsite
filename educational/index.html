					<h3>Film</h3>
				</div>


					<div class = "class_summary">
						<p>Students will learn essential storytelling techniques in cinematography, production management, directing, and post-production.</p>
						<p>The film bootcamp is designed for students who have little or no filmmaking experience. We will teach you the process of making a film from start to finish. The program begins with three days of intensive skill-building, during which students will develop short original screenplays. On day four, students will take their scripts and direct short films in pairs. Day five will cover post-production and distribution techniques.</p>
						<div class = "class_bullets">
							<ul>
								<li>Gain experience with digital camera operation.</li>
								<li>Learn to create a story, and structure it in screenplay format.</li>
								<li>Practice directing skills, learn how to translate script to screen.</li>
								<li>Grasp the techniques of film editing, how to polish in post production.</li>
								<li>Get your films out in the world through film festival submission!</li>
							</ul>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Mondays – Camera Operation:</b> We will introduce basic camera concepts and controls: exposure, ISO, shutter speed, aperture, focus, and shot composition. We will also talk briefly about the creative process and brainstorming ideas for new films.</li>
								<li><b>Tuesdays – Screenwriting & Pre-Preproduction:</b> Learn how to take the seed of an idea and make it into a formatted, usable screenplay. We will also go deeper into how to prepare for a film shoot.</li>
								<li><b>Wednesday – Shot Design & Production:</b> We will elaborate on cinematography: how to compose shots that go together well, and that serve a story. We will also discuss how to “shoot for the cut” – shooting in a way that makes editing and post-production easier.</li>
								<li><b>Thursday – Editing:</b> Go into the nitty gritty of video and audio editing techniques. Techniques in everything from splicing footage to matching externally recorded audio to very detailed discussions about audio and video codecs will be covered.</li>
								<li><b>Friday – Postproduction & Distribution:</b> We will get into how a good edit can become great. Polishing techniques such as color correction, audio balancing, and optimal compression will be taught. Also, we will discuss how you can tackle the process of submitting your films to film festivals, and other ways you can get your work seen.</li>

					<div class = "class_summary">
						<p>It&#8217;s all fun and games until someone gets stranded in space with just a paddle and their wits. &#8217;Yes and,&#8217; &#8217;placing a detail,&#8217; &#8217;rule of 3&#8217;s,&#8217; and many other skills will prepare you for the next time life throws you into orbit or onto a stage.</p>
						<p>This improv class is for beginners, intermediates, and anyone who wants to hone their talents. Students will learn about creating characters and storytelling, and build spontaneity, confidence, and wit. At the end of the week students will participate in an improv performance in a safe environment.</p>
						<div class = "class_bullets">

								<li><b>Tuesdays – Storytelling:</b> Here we talk about the importance of storytelling, what makes a story, and how we can use exercises to make driven stories. Comedic stories have various elements in them such as clash of context, exaggeration, and plot twists which we’ll go over in class. We’ll then ask how a character can serve or drive plot. Then we discuss the classic things that make a ‘story’ and how we use some elements of story and subvert some in improv.</li>
								<li><b>Wednesdays – Character:</b> Show you ways to create effective characters for comedic improv. Activities involve creating unique characters and using them in performance with more review and practice.</li>
								<li><b>Thursdays – More Tools and New Activities:</b> More exercises that help other aspects of improv. We will re-emphasize creativity in all aspects of improvisation. Included is more improv performance followed by presented games.</li>
								<li><b>Fridays – Improvisational Opportunities:</b> Last Improv together as a class. Review and feedback on what needs to be improved in student performances. Then lecture on where you could go in NYC to improve, continuing improvisation in theatre, and how to start your own improv troupe.</li>
